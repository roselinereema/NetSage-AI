# Top Lessons Learned

Curated from resolved cases. Agent updates this file after each case closure.
Read this file at session start. For detailed case history, refer to Jira tickets.

Maximum 10 entries. Each entry: one actionable lesson in 1-3 lines.

### Promotion Criteria

**Add a lesson when ALL of these apply:**
1. **Broadly applicable** — the lesson would help diagnose or avoid a class of issues, not just one specific device or config
2. **Non-obvious** — the root cause or diagnostic shortcut wasn't predictable from CLAUDE.md principles alone
3. **Not already captured** — no existing entry covers the same insight (scan all entries before adding)

**Replace an existing entry when:**
- The file has 10 entries AND the new lesson is more broadly applicable than the weakest existing one
- Remove the weakest entry (most narrow or device-specific) and add the new one

**Do NOT add a lesson for:**
- Routine findings with no surprising diagnostic insight (e.g., "interface was admin-shutdown")
- Transient or self-resolved issues with no actionable takeaway
- Issues caused by lab setup or intentional test scenarios
- Fixes already obvious from the 7 Core Principles or protocol skill checklists

**Lesson format:**
- Lead with the diagnostic insight or decision rule, not the story
- Include the symptom pattern that triggers the lesson (so the agent recognizes it next time)

1. **Source-first on SLA failure**: When an SLA path fails, always run `get_interfaces(source_device)` immediately. A shutdown `source_interface` (from paths.json) is immediately identifiable and is the root cause — do not escalate to protocol-level investigation until source device interfaces are confirmed Up/Up.

2. **Always pass `source_ip` in traceroute for SLA paths**: Without a source IP, traceroute may succeed via an alternate path and mask the actual monitored-path failure. Always use `traceroute(source_device, destination_ip, source=source_ip)` when `source_ip` is defined in paths.json.

3. **OSPF timer and network-type mismatch prevents adjacency formation**: Mismatched hello/dead intervals or network types between OSPF neighbors prevent adjacency despite physical connectivity and L3 reachability. Cisco IOS defaults to hello 10/dead 40 on broadcast/point-to-point links — mismatches arise from explicit non-default configuration. Network-type mismatch (POINT_TO_MULTIPOINT vs POINT_TO_POINT) causes automatic timer divergence (hello 30/dead 120 vs 10/40). Zero neighbors on an Up/Up interface = suspect timers or network type; always inspect `get_ospf(device, "interfaces")` on both sides before investigating other causes. Fix the misconfigured side — never match the outlier. ABR special case: when inter-area routes suddenly vanish while Area 1 neighbors remain healthy, immediately check the ABR's Area 0 interface dead-intervals — non-standard values cascade to all downstream areas losing both inter-area and external routes.

4. **LSDB vs RIB mismatch → adjacency or config issue**: If LSAs present in database but routes missing from RIB, root cause is OSPF adjacency failure or config error, not LSA flooding. Check neighbor states before investigating SPF calculations.

5. **Administratively shutdown interfaces break SLA paths — check all scope devices, not just source**: Shutdown interfaces on any device in the path (source, transit, egress, or destination) break SLA reachability. Transit devices like E1C (NAT_EDGE/ASBR) are especially impactful — shutdown OSPF or BGP-facing interfaces kill all adjacencies and cascade failures across multiple SLA paths. When `get_interfaces` shows admin-down on a scope device, that's the root cause — no further protocol investigation needed. Always check `get_interfaces` on the breaking hop before diving into protocol tools.

6. **ABR is a critical single point of failure — detect via stale LSAs**: When an ABR loses backbone (Area 0) adjacencies, all downstream areas lose inter-area and external routes simultaneously. A single broken ABR cascades failures across multiple SLA paths. Monitor ABR backbone adjacencies aggressively. Diagnostic: check LSDB for Type 3 or Router LSAs with age 1500+ seconds — stale LSAs indicate the originating router (typically ABR) has broken inter-area adjacencies preventing LSA refresh. Compare LSA ages across neighbors; identical stale ages across multiple neighbors confirms the source ABR's failure.

7. **OSPF passive-interface silently blocks adjacencies**: Passive-interface prevents hello exchange but leaves the physical link and layer 3 connectivity appearing healthy. Result: interface Up/Up, layer 3 reachable, but neighbor count zero. Always inspect `get_ospf(device, "interfaces")` for `passive` flag when neighbors are absent despite correct parameters (timers, area, auth, network type). This is especially critical on ABRs where passive Area N interfaces prevent inter-area route propagation.

8. **Verify intent vs actual state before proposing a fix**: INTENT.json describes the desired network design, not the current device config. Attributes like `area_type`, `stub`, and `default_originate` may differ from the running configuration. Always verify with `get_<protocol>(device, "config")` before basing a fix on INTENT.json values — misreading intent as actual state leads to proposing a fix for a non-existent misconfiguration.

9. **Aggressive BGP hold timers cause dual-ISP session flapping**: When both ISP sessions on an ASBR flap simultaneously, check `get_bgp(device, "neighbors", neighbor=<ip>)` for mismatched "hold time" vs "Configured hold time" lines. Non-default `timers <keepalive> <hold>` on neighbor statements (e.g. 3/9 instead of 60/180) make sessions fragile — any network jitter causes hold expiry and teardown, which cascades to downstream default route loss. Fix: `no neighbor X timers <k> <h>` to restore defaults. No session reset required if the change is applied inline; IOS renegotiates on the next OPEN.

10. **Fix one layer at a time — never bundle cross-layer fixes**: When investigation reveals issues at multiple diagnostic layers (e.g., interface admin-down AND missing BGP default-originate), propose only the lowest-layer fix first. Verify whether the SLA path recovers. Higher-layer "issues" may be symptoms or consequences of the lower-layer failure, not independent problems. Bundling cross-layer fixes into one approval adds unnecessary risk and makes rollback ambiguous. Each fix is one assess_risk → request_approval → push_config → verify cycle.
