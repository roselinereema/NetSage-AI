"""UT-028 — MCP Server tool registration: verify all 15 tools are registered.

Tests for MCPServer.py — validates that every expected tool is registered on
the FastMCP instance and that no tool is accidentally omitted after refactoring.

Validates:
- All 15 expected tool names are registered
- No extra tools are present (strict equality)
- Tool count is exactly 15

Design note: MCPServer.py calls setup_logging() at import time, which sets
propagate=False on the 'ainoc' logger. To avoid breaking pytest caplog in later
test files, setup_logging() is patched to a no-op during import.
