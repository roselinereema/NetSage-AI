"""
UT-003 — Tail Follow Drain Mechanism

Verifies tail_follow(filepath, drain):
1. Normal lines are yielded as written.
2. Setting drain[0] = True causes subsequent buffered lines to be skipped.
3. After the drain seek, drain[0] is reset to False.
4. New lines written after drain are yielded again.
