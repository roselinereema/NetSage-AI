MCP tools: request_approval, post_approval_outcome

request_approval:
  Sends an approval request to Discord and waits for the operator's emoji reaction.
  Returns the decision so the agent can act on it (push_config on approval, log on rejection).

  If Discord is not configured (DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN / DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID missing),
  returns {"decision": "skipped"} so the agent falls back to CLI-only approval.

post_approval_outcome:
  Posts the final outcome (approved+verified, rejected, expired) as a reply to the
  original approval message. Called by the agent AFTER fix + verification — not inside
  request_approval — so that the verification result can be included.

    """
    Request operator approval for a proposed configuration change via Discord.

    Posts a rich embed to the configured Discord channel showing findings,
    proposed commands, target devices, and risk level. The bot adds ✅ and ❌
    reactions — the operator taps one to approve or reject. The tool polls
    Discord's API until a human reacts or the timeout expires.

    The timeout defaults to APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_MINUTES from .env (or 10 if unset).
    Pass timeout_minutes explicitly to override.

    If Discord is not configured, returns {"decision": "skipped"} and the
    agent must log to Jira that no approval channel is configured and proceed
    to Session Closure without pushing config.

    After this tool returns, the agent must call post_approval_outcome with
    the message_id and final outcome (including verification result for
    approved decisions).

    Args:
        issue_key: Jira issue key (optional, for context in the Discord embed)
        summary: One-line description of the proposed fix
        findings: Full findings table in markdown format
        commands: List of CLI commands to apply
        devices: List of target device names
        risk_level: Risk level from assess_risk (low / medium / high)
        timeout_minutes: Minutes to wait before expiring (default: from APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_MINUTES env var, or 10)
